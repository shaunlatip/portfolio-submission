                                The new check in station my study centers on was <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-16/wellness">launched</a> in September of 2021 as part of a new, integrated Health and Wellness center, combining the previously separated Health Services alongside Counseling and Psychological Services into one centralized point of care in the middle of Brown University's campus.

                                <br/>As someone interested in and personally invested towards the accessibility of healthcare on campus, I wanted to evaluate the experiences of patients to understand and communicate the condition of this facet of Brown's campus healthcare system.

                        Instead, I focused on observing how each user navigated the station, including how long they lingered on each section, and their interactions with staff.

                        <li>Half of these users stood and waited for several minutes while staff were busy, all without noticing the printed instructional page to use the computer.</li>
                        <li>Most of them seemed somewhat confused upon entering the check-in area, with the staff telling most to just use the computer.</li>

                        <li>User A spent 10 minutes rescheduling with staff, as User A’s schedule conflicted with many of the suggested times.</li>

                            <li>User A wished the desktop involved less physical contact, as once the student before A coughed on the keyboard as A was running late with no time to sanitize. They also wished a way existed to display a wait time and queue for those waiting.</li>

                    <p>
                        I then created the following storyboard to communicate the user journey of Scattered Sakshi. 
                        I decided to map Sakshi's journey. One reason behind why I chose Sakshi was that I felt Sakshi's user journey could highlight instances where the existing check-in process could leave frequent users disappointed, especially within the context of their broader life.

                        <p>
                            Sakshi spends the day cycling through lectures, volunteer work, and finally her lab.

                        <img src="checkin/panel2.png"/>
                        <p>
                            Sakshi is working at her lab, expecting to finish when the lab runs into an unexpected problem. Her Professor asks her stay and help out: “Just another 15 minutes!”
                        </p>

                        <img src="checkin/panel3.png"/>
                        <p>
                            30 minutes later, Sakshi sprints out of lab, barely catching the bus to 450 Brook St.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She arrives at the building, slamming open the door and sprinting up the stairs, 
                            as the user before her leaves their booth while coughing right into the keyboard.
                        </p>

                        <img src="checkin/panel5.png"/>
                        <p>
                            After heading straight towards the nearest available counter, Sakshi, while grossed out, furiously clicks and types through the program just as she's done a thousand times.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                        <img src="checkin/panel6.png"/>
                        <p>
                            Through each section, Sakshi ignores the paragraphs of dense instructions and text; using her experience to speed through the clunky program ASAP to not miss her appointment.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                        <img src="checkin/panel7.png"/>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately after the program says she is too late, she goes to the Greeter Area and makes her case:
                            "I'm sorry I'm late - I came here as fast as I could!"
                        </p>

                        <img src="checkin/panel8.png"/>
                        <p>
                            They spend the next ten minutes trying to reschedule. They go back and forth: “2:00PM? No I cant do then, could 2:00pm Wednesday work?" "...What about Thursday?...Friday? [and so on]...”                  
                        </p>
                        </div>


                        <div className={styles.storyboardPanel}>
                        <img src="checkin/panel9.png"/>
                        <p>
                            After scheduling another appointment tightly packed between her commitments, Sakshi walks away disappointed, back again where she first started. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        All in all, I really enjoyed being able to conduct this research project. Despite being a frequent user of the check in station myself, I was surprised at how my findings of what different people wanted and got out from their experience checking in could differ so much from my own expectations. It was also a great experience to apply web design principles I knew from theory to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive webpage to showcase my research process. As I learn more, I hope to sometime redesign the way users access clinical care at 450 Brook St. based on my findings.

                        If you are taking a look at this page for CSCI 1300, I would love to hear about any and all suggestions you might have regarding my process.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Thank you for taking a look at my work!
